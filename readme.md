# NFL Conquest Map

A web-based conquest game where players draft NFL teams and battle for territorial control throughout the season.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Supabase Multiplayer

1. Create a `.env.local` (or `.env`) file and expose your Supabase credentials to Vite:
   ```ini
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```
2. Inside Supabase, create the table used for game sessions and enable Realtime on it:
   ```sql
   create table if not exists public.game_sessions (
     id text primary key,
     state jsonb not null,
     updated_at timestamptz not null default timezone('utc', now())
   );
   ```
   - If Row Level Security is enabled, allow anonymous reads and upserts on `game_sessions`.
   - In the Supabase Dashboard â†’ Realtime, enable replication for the `game_sessions` table.
3. Start the app (`npm run dev`). A session ID and shareable URL appear in the control panel once Supabase connects. Share the link with other players to join the same lobby.
4. If Supabase variables are missing, the app automatically falls back to local-only persistence.

## How to Play

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Add 2-8 players with unique names
   - Configure game settings:
     - Picks per player (1-3 teams)
     - Margin rules (8+ point wins = extra capture)
     - Playoff boost (+1 capture for playoff wins)
     - Super Bowl sweep (winner takes all territories)

2. **Draft Phase**
   - Snake draft format
   - Players take turns selecting teams
   - Each player's color is determined by their first pick

3. **Season Phase**
   - Import weekly results via CSV
   - Watch as territories change hands
   - Monitor standings and territorial control

## CSV Format

Import game results using this format:

```csv
week,winner,loser,margin,isPlayoff,isSuperBowl
1,KC,CIN,7,false,false
1,SF,DAL,10,false,false
18,KC,BAL,3,true,false
19,KC,SF,10,true,true
```

- `week`: Week number (1-19+)
- `winner`: Team code of the winning team
- `loser`: Team code of the losing team
- `margin`: Point differential (optional)
- `isPlayoff`: true/false
- `isSuperBowl`: true/false

## Victory Conditions
